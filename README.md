The Book Store Simple Project is a dynamic web application created using Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Bootstrap. It is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to add, edit, and delete books from the database, as well as add and remove books from their inventory.

## Installation

To run this application, you will need:

- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Tomcat 9
- MySQL database server
- Maven
- Java IDE

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from GitHub: git clone `https://github.com/P4r1nc3/CRUD_Book_Store`
2. Import the project into Eclipse: File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects
3. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file
4. Build and run the project on Apache Tomcat

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:1003/`.

The home page will display a list of all books in the database, with the option to add a new book or edit/delete an existing book. You can also navigate to the inventory page, which will display a list of books in your inventory, with the option to add or remove books.
